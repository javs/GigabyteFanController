# GigabyteFanController

Some recent Gigabyte motherboards have a custom, BIOS based, fan controller that overrides the 2nd set of fans (typically in the ITE8792 IC). This program accepts one option to disable/enable that controller so other program can be used to drive the fans normally.

The controller is typically automatically enabled on boot/resume.

Based on code from LibreHardwareMonitor.
